This a text-base fire effect demo. You really have to squint your eyes and use your imagination
for it to work.

I got the inspiration to this while seeing an animated gif at a talk at ElixirConf. Also, as an exercise because
I didnt know how to model a two dimensional array in Elixir.

I added a test to the fire calculation so that anyone can try to calculate the canvas average, since my method
of doing this doesnt look elegant at all. Functional maybe, but elegant, I dont think so.

If you are interested in this, just reimplement the Canvas.average/4 function and run the tests.

Please make any comments regarding any part of this code.

This is the first time ever that I use ncurses, so I couldnt find a way to add color to it. Once I find out how to do that, it will
definitely look better.
